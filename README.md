# cryptocard
repo for the crypto giftcard system.

## precurse
if you use this and problems come your way i am not responsible for your actions. this is closed licence code. use at your own risk to yourself.

## Description
this is a pet project. its not anything serious. 

The idea behind this is simple. Send a secure mailer with a registered wallet with crypto currency automated and bought for a loved one.


## components
- Square checkout
- django
- coinbase API
- clicksend API 
-- for secure pin mail


## Reasons i did not stand this up.
Please think about the pitfalls of an idea like this for a small company before you use this to build your empire.
The biggest conern i had with this was chargeback fraud. once a wallet is drained anyone can walk away with stolen currency. there is no reprecussion for crypto giftcards yet.
